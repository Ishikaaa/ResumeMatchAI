Challenges -
1. Working with doc file
2.

TODO -
1. Can use TF-IDF or similar weighting before embedding.
2. Optional: Use LLM for final scoring
After FAISS retrieves top N resumes, pass them with JD keywords to an LLM to score relevance.
This mimics human reasoning and reduces irrelevant matches.
3. Add loggers


more improvements -
1. Folder structure can be better
2. can try more embedding models
3. Can be better if we make sure that the job description is in particular format - like - responsibilities, specialist, etc are mandatory
4. if there is only 1 relevant reasume, then also it is returning 5 resumes. But it should not.
